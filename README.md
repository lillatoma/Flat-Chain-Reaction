# Flat-Chain-Reaction
Flat, 2D recreation of the Android game called Chain Reaction

The reason for this project to exist is that in the original Chain Reaction game, the 3D grid for touch detection doesn't fit their visual cue.
That means that one might have to tap outside the grid to get the tap to register properly inside the grid.

With this 2D recreation, I fixed that issue.

### Possible things in the future:

- Enemy AI
- Changable playernames
- Android version (no Play Store)
